Welcome to my repository where I curate a list of TV shows and movies I'm interested in watching or have already downloaded as torrents. This repository serves as my personal catalog, making it easy for me to keep track of what I want to watch and what I've already enjoyed.

In this digital age, entertainment options are vast and varied. Keeping track of TV shows and movies you want to watch can be a daunting task. This repository aims to simplify the process by providing a structured list of both desired and downloaded content.
